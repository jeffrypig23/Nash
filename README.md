# Nash
In game theory, the Nash equilibrium is a solution concept of a non-cooperative game involving two or more players in which each player is assumed to know the equilibrium strategies of the other players, and no player has anything to gain by changing only his own strategy.

If each player has chosen a strategy and no player can benefit by changing strategies while the other players keep theirs unchanged, then the current set of strategy choices and the corresponding payoffs constitutes a Nash equilibrium. The Nash equilibrium is one of the foundational concepts in game theory. The reality of the Nash equilibrium of a game can be tested using experimental economics methods.

Usually this is tedious to calculate, so I made a calculator to do it for you :P

## Installation

### MacOS
There is already an applicaiton preinstalled with macOS that runs Jars, so you should be good to go. Just [download](https://github.com/jeffrypig23/Nash/raw/master/Nash.jar) and run the Jar.

### Windows
Java must be installed on your computer in order to run the jar. In order to do that, and get the Jar onto your computer, follow these steps:

1. Download the installer for [Java](http://javadl.oracle.com/webapps/download/AutoDL?BundleId=227549_e758a0de34e24606bca991d704f6dcbf)

2. Run the installer

3. After it finishes intalling, restart your computer

4. Download the [.jar](https://github.com/jeffrypig23/Nash/raw/master/Nash.jar)

5. Open up command prompt, and type in `java -jar `, and then drag and drop the .jar into the prompt to get the path to the file. Then hit enter to run the command. You should then see the main window appear
